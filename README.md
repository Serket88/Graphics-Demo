##  Overview

This program demonstrates a lot of the knowledge I gained from an upperlevel graphics class, where I implemented my own versions of OpenGL in order to better understand computer graphics.  This particular assignment focuses on mastery of OpenGL and understanding of graphics.  The program renders a distribution of two different meshes in a three dimensional environment with random values assigned to various shader aspects, along with the ability to control the camera and "walk" around the environment using the WASD keys and looking around with the mouse.

##  Building & Running

1)  Create a directory called "build" and change to it.
2)  Run the command "cmake ../"
3)  Run the command "make"
4)  Execute the file with "./A4 ../resources/"
